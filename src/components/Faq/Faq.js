            <h2 className="item__title">Choosing The Best Option</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p className="item__content">The food delivery meal kit suppliers that we compare are all very good value for money, but even so you’ll want to ensure that you’re getting your money’s worth, with an effective meal delivery system as well as access to a whole range of different recipes, even catering for those with
            special dietary requirements. When choosing the best food box subscriptions, there are several things that you should consider before making the final decision.</p>
            <h4 className="item__subtitle">Cost</h4>
            <p className="item__content">When selecting your make at home meals, you’ll want to ensure that they’re reasonably priced. Usually, you tend to find that having ingredients sent to home from a meal kit provider works out cheaper than if you were to visit the grocery store every week, but sometimes making these
            calculations can help you get the most out of your investment. Depending on the plan you select, you can find the amount of recipes available varying, so you’ll want to keep a close eye on the cost of your plan and why it’s the price that it is. To help you analyse the costs of the meal kit providers, we have many meal delivery kit reviews on our website.</p>
            <h4 className="item__subtitle">Ingredients</h4>
            <p className="item__content">If you’re selecting an ingredient delivery service, you’ll want to double check that the ingredients you’re receiving are of a high-quality, otherwise you’re probably not getting your money’s worth. The make at home food delivery services that we compare all provide customers with
            organically-sourced ingredients, which are kept fresh naturally during delivery using insulating materials. Therefore, when selecting one of our recommended food recipe delivery services, you can rest assured that the ingredients you’re using are completely natural and grown organically,
            making them not only more delicious, but also providing you with the vital nutrients that you need.</p>
            <h4 className="item__subtitle">Flexibility</h4>
            <p className="item__content">One of the main reasons for people investing in a home recipe delivery service is because they don’t have the time to plan and cook a meal themselves, so it’s highly likely that they don’t have time to sit around at home and wait for the delivery either. As a result, you’ll want to ensure that your chosen recipe subscription box provider can adjust the delivery times to suit your schedule or, even better, simply deliver the box straight to your door and leave it there until you’re able to return home (with the appropriate insulating materials, of course). Some of our meal recipe delivery services even include the option to change or cancel the delivery via their app, so flexibility really is an important factor when selecting your recipe delivery service.</p>
            <h4 className="item__subtitle">Nutrition</h4>
            <p className="item__content">Not everyone has the same dietary requirements, meaning that only the best food box delivery service will include recipes suited to those of all nutritional requirements. If you’re looking for a vegan recipe delivery for example, our meal kit providers will be able to provide you with the
            nutrition that you need to be satisfied with your meal kit delivery. Additionally, some of our recipe delivery services will cater dishes to children, ensuring that they’re receiving the nutrients that they need while growing.</p>
            <h4 className="item__subtitle">Shipping</h4>
            <p className="item__content">All of our comparison of home meal delivery services will consider the shipping services offered by the meal kit provider. Depending on the provider that you select, you may be inclined to pay an additional shipping fee, but it’s up to you whether this seems necessary or not. Alternatively, many of our meal kit providers don’t charge shipping, however they might simply increase the general price of the meal plan to make up for this, which is why analysing the pricing is crucial when choosing the best meal subscription boxes.</p>

            <h2 className="item__title">What Kind Of Meal Plans Are There?</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p className="item__content">Of course, the type of meal plan that you select will rely entirely on what meals you want delivered, as well as the number of mouths that you have to feed. Aware of the portions required in some households, as well as the differing nutritional requirements among individuals, many meal kit providers offer meal plans to cater for absolutely everyone.</p>
            <h4 className="item__subtitle">2-Person Plan</h4>
            <p className="item__content">Undeniably the most popular type of meal plan selected, the 2-person plan is able to cater for, you guessed it, two people! Usually, this plan will only consist of dinner recipes, and the number of recipes included in the food delivery meal kits will depend on the plan that you select. With this
            in mind, you should consider how the more recipes you decide to incorporate in your plan, the more expensive your service will be.</p>
            <h4 className="item__subtitle">Veggie Plan</h4>
            <p className="item__content">A select few of our meal recipe delivery services will offer a veggie plan, allowing those with the specific dietary requirement to try succulent meals without feeling left out. As well as this, it’s important to note that even the regular meal plans are often tailored to specific nutritional
            guidelines, with gluten-free and dairy-free recipes often featuring on menus. Furthermore, while veggie plans are extremely useful for those that refuse to eat meat, it’s worth noting that sometimes the veggie menu lacks in variation, so we hope you thoroughly enjoy the same recipe!</p>

            <h2 className="item__title">How Do The Meal Plans Work?</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p className="item__content">
                Across the board, almost all of our meal kit providers offer the exact same experience when you opt for meal recipe delivery, however they can differ slightly which is why we recommend you read their individual reviews. Essentially though, you simply select a plan that matches your
                culinary requirements, including the number of recipes you want a week and the number of mouths that you have to feed. Once you’ve managed to select a plan that’s perfect for your lifestyle, you’ll then have the option to select meals from the menu, usually offering a whole array
                of different recipes with powerful flavours.
            </p>
            <p className="item__content">This is where it differs though – some of our providers within the meal delivery plans comparison will deliver the meal ready-made, simply needing to be reheated, whereas others deliver the ingredients, giving you the opportunity to cook the meal yourself. Either way, they will be delivered to your door, some at a specific delivery time of your choosing, and others at any time of the day, staying insulated on your doorstep until you’re able to return home.</p>

            <h2 className="item__title">Ranking Methodology</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p className="item__content">We like to ensure that we provide you with accurate food delivery reviews, which is why we’ve decided to rank the meal kit providers on our website to help you make a decision that matches your specific dietary needs. At the very top, we have Home Chef with a rating of 9.8/10, simply because of their convenience and undisputable variation of recipes, catering for specific dietary requirements.</p>
            <p className="item__content">Secondly, you can find Sun Basket, close behind Home Chef with a rating of 9.6/10. Sun Basket in particular puts a large emphasis on the use of organic, naturally-sourced produce, adding flavour and nutrition to your meal every single evening. Towards the bottom, we have the likes of Hello Fresh and Healthy Chef, and despite having ratings of 8.1/10 and 7.9/10 respectively, they still provide excellent services to their customers, just perhaps not to the same standards as those that proudly hold the top spots.</p>
            <p className="item__content">With so many meal subscription box reviews on the web, selecting the best food box delivery service can be quite the challenge. Having said that, you can make the selection process a lot easier if you simply consider the above factors, making your life a lot easier and less-stressful in the kitchen. Whether you simply want the convenience of reheating a fresh meal or you want to feel like a culinary genius over the stove, each of our meal kit providers will have the perfect service for you.
